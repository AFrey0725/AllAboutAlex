                My name is Alex and I am 28 years old. I have a one-year-old daughter named Indie. 
                I had a chiweenie named Sammy for 17 years, but he passed away back in January.
                My current dog is a dachshund puppy named Misha. I like to play video games on occasion, 
                play musical instruments, read books, and am a relatively good drawer. In high school I 
                was in marching band and played the clarinet. As an adult, I enjoy spending my time as a 
                mother to my daughter and being with my boyfriend Waylon. I was born and raised in Sioux 
                City, IA and moved to Sioux Falls, SD in 2018. I enjoy listening to all types of music 
                and listen to music daily. I also really enjoy coloring as I consider it to be theraputic.
                When I was younger, I would take my dog Sammy on long walks around the neighborhood and 
                take him to the parks. I like to play sports on occasion, but have to be careful as I have 
                a very bad back due to an unknown injury. I live everyday to the fullest and try my best to 
                be better than the day before.
